This project was created by following along with Stephen Grider's [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/) course on Udemy. This course used Phoenix 1.2.

Below is the default Phoenix 1.2 readme --

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
